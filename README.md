### I made a bot playing the lumberjack telegram game

# **I.	Quick description of the game**

In this game, the user plays as a lumberjack cutting an infinitely tall tree. The goal is to chop the highest possible amount of wood pieces before you run out of time, by choping on either the left or right side of the tree. However, while choping, the lumberjack must also dodge the failing tree branches, by standing on the opposite side of the tree. Touching a branch leads to a game over. An image from the game is shown below.
